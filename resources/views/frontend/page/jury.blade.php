                            <p>
                                Alper Gülle is a full-time lecturer at Antalya Bilim University, where he is actively involved in
                                both teaching and research in the field of architecture. He completed his undergraduate
                                studies in 2013, graduating from the Department of Architecture at Eskişehir Anadolu
                                University. His education during this period laid the groundwork for his growing interest in
                                the theoretical and practical dimensions of architectural design.
                                Between 2016 and 2018, he worked as a designer in the design office of Anadolu
                                University, contributing to the development and execution of various design and
                                construction projects. This professional experience allowed him to bridge the gap between
                                academic theory and real-world architectural practice, refining his conceptual, technical
                                design, and project coordination skills. Simultaneously, he pursued his graduate studies,
                                receiving a master’s degree in Building Science from Anadolu University in 2018.
                                Currently, he is a Ph.D. candidate in the Architectural Design program at İstanbul
                                Technical University. His doctoral research focuses on the complex relationship between
                                cognitive processes and representational mechanisms in architectural design. Through
                                this work, he seeks to explore how cognitive frameworks influence creative thinking and
                                decision-making in design, as well as the role of representational media in shaping
                                architectural ideas and solutions. His research aims to contribute to a deeper
                                understanding of the mental and visual processes that underlie architectural design
                                practice.
                                He has been enrolled in academic and professional activities that are centered on
                                architectural design and theory, design education, and representation in architectural
                                design, particularly interested in fostering critical thinking and creativity in design studios,
                                encouraging designers to explore the interplay between conceptual ideas and
                                representational media.
